# Worklog

Append-only iteration log for xiaodaoyiba v3. Newest entries on top.

## Iteration 3 — S-003 — port server/ Socket.IO entry + Room + matchmaking from v2

**Did:** Copied `xiaodaoyiba-v2/packages/server/src/{index.ts,matchmaking.ts,rooms/Room.ts,index.test.ts}` verbatim into `server/src/`. The v3 `@xdyb/shared` barrel already re-exports every symbol the port needs (`SHARED_PACKAGE_VERSION`, `Effect`, `resolveRound`, `resolveRps`, `pickStrategyForIndex`, `getBotStrategy`, `seededRng`, `Rng`, `BotKind`, `BotStrategy`, `RoundHistoryEntry`, `RoundInputs`, `ActionKind`, `RpsChoice`, `PlayerState`, `ROUND_TOTAL_MS`, `TIE_NARRATION_HOLD_MS`) — no shimming needed. Switched `server/build` to a `tsup.config.ts` that sets `noExternal: ['@xdyb/shared']`, so `node server/dist/index.js` boots without needing a separately-built copy of the workspace shared package on disk.

**Verified (acceptance for S-003):**
- `pnpm test` → **83 tests passed (79 shared + 4 server) in <1s**.
- `server/src/index.test.ts` boots a real Socket.IO server on a random port and drives 4 spec scenarios via `socket.io-client`: `/healthz` returns shared version + room count; host creates room, joiner joins via 4-letter code, both sockets receive synchronized `room:snapshot`; `room:addBot` adds a bot then `room:start` + `room:choice` triggers a `room:effects` broadcast whose first effect is `ROUND_START`; bad inputs (empty nickname, bogus 4-letter code) emit `room:error` with the expected error code.
- `pnpm typecheck` → green across all 3 workspaces.
- `pnpm --filter @xdyb/server build` produces `server/dist/index.js` (~41 KB, with shared bundled in).
- `PORT=3458 node server/dist/index.js` + `curl /healthz` returns `{"ok":true,"shared":"0.0.1","rooms":0,...}` — the bundled artifact actually listens on the network, satisfying the S-003 acceptance bar literally.

**Notes for next iteration:** S-004 (server/sim.ts headless CLI) is the next bottleneck for §A1–A4. After that, S-005 (Godot client) becomes unblocked. The Room class already exposes the full Socket.IO surface the eventual Godot `Net.gd` autoload needs — `room:create`, `room:join`, `room:addBot`, `room:start`, `room:choice`, `room:winnerChoice`, `room:rematch`, `room:leave` — and emits `room:snapshot`, `room:effects`, `room:winnerChoice`, `room:error`. The §H3 winner-agency flow is intact (9-second `WINNER_CHOICE_BUDGET_MS`, auto-pick fallback timer).

## Iteration 2 — S-002 — port shared/ game logic verbatim from v2

**Did:** Copied `xiaodaoyiba-v2/packages/shared/src/game/` and
`narrative/lines.ts` verbatim into `xiaodaoyiba-v3/shared/src/`:
`timing.ts`, `rps.ts`, `engine.ts`, `effects.ts`, `types.ts`,
`bots/{counter,random,iron,mirror,seedRng,types,index}.ts`,
`game/index.ts`, `narrative/{lines,index}.ts`, plus the existing v2
test suites `rps.test.ts`, `engine.test.ts`, `lines.test.ts`. Replaced
the 3-line placeholder `shared/src/index.ts` with a real barrel that
re-exports `./game/index.js` and `./narrative/index.js` so consumers
write `import { resolveRound, ROUND_TOTAL_MS, defaultNarrator } from
'@xdyb/shared'`.

**Verified (acceptance for S-002):**
- `pnpm --filter @xdyb/shared test` → **79 tests passed in 435ms**
  (criterion: ≥10 tests in <5s — exceeded by an order of magnitude).
  Suites: rps.test.ts (46), engine.test.ts (20), lines.test.ts (13).
- `pnpm typecheck` → green across all 3 workspaces.
- `engine.ts` exports `resolveRound` (default export check via
  `grep -n 'export function resolveRound' shared/src/game/engine.ts`).
- `bots/{counter,random,iron,mirror}.ts` each export their named
  `*Strategy` symbol; `pickStrategyForIndex(0..3)` cycles through them.
- `grep -rn PHASE_T_RETURN shared/src/` returns **0 hits** — v6 §K2
  satisfied. `timing.ts` has only the 6 phase constants (REVEAL, PREP,
  RUSH, PULL_PANTS, STRIKE, IMPACT) plus the totals.
- 6-phase timeline sums to exactly `ROUND_TOTAL_MS=4700` (REVEAL 1500
  + ACTION_TOTAL_MS 3200), enforced by an at-import-time check inside
  `engine.ts` and re-asserted in `engine.test.ts`.

**Notes for next iteration:** The narrative pool is already at 8 tie
variants + dedicated `allSameLine` + 7 `pullOwnPantsUpVariants`,
which already covers FINAL_GOAL §C8's "≥5 distinct lines per pool"
target. No additional work needed there. Next bottleneck is S-003
(server/index.ts + Room.ts + matchmaking.ts) followed by S-004
(server/sim.ts) to satisfy A1–A4.

## Iteration 1 — S-001 — pnpm workspace scaffolding

**Did:** Scaffolded the pnpm monorepo root per FINAL_GOAL §"Repository
structure". Created `package.json` (workspace scripts: dev / build /
test / typecheck / sim / serve), `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (lists
`shared`, `server`), `tsconfig.base.json` (strict TS6 baseline ported
from v2), `.nvmrc` (Node 20), and `scripts/{dev,build,serve-html5}.sh`.
Created minimal `shared/` (`@xdyb/shared`) and `server/` (`@xdyb/server`)
package skeletons with valid `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` so pnpm
recognizes them; the actual v2 ports (engine, RPS, bots, narrative,
Room, sim) land in subsequent subtasks (S-002…S-004).

**Verified (acceptance for S-001):**
- `pnpm install` exits 0 in **~3s** on this machine (criterion: ≤60s).
- `pnpm -r ls --depth -1` lists both `@xdyb/server` and `@xdyb/shared`
  alongside the root workspace.
- `pnpm test` → green (vitest with `--passWithNoTests`).
- `pnpm typecheck` → green.
- `pnpm sim` runs the placeholder entry without error (proves the
  `pnpm --filter @xdyb/server sim` wiring works end-to-end).
- `bash -n` clean on all three shell scripts; `serve-html5.sh` exits
  with the expected "build first" message when no HTML5 export exists
  yet (proves graceful failure path).

**Notes for next iteration:** The server's HTML5 serve script sets COOP
/ COEP headers because Godot 4 HTML5 threads need SharedArrayBuffer —
otherwise the canvas refuses to boot in the browser. The script is a
single inlined Node program rather than a `npx serve` config to avoid
adding another dependency just for two response headers.

**Outstanding (high-leverage next):** Port `shared/src/game/` verbatim
from v2 (S-002), then `server/src/{index.ts, sim.ts, rooms/Room.ts,
matchmaking.ts}` (S-003 / S-004). After that the headless sim path
(criterion A1–A4) is unblocked and the Godot client can begin (S-005).
